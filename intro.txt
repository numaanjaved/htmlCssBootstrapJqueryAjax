Congratulations that you reached here. 

What you have done in yuor last task, it is now time to create all of that in html css, bootstrap and jquery. 

javascript will not be used for everything now, the front end should be in html css, focus more on using bootstrap. 

jquery and javascript and bootstrap should be used where most essential.

Backend validation, storage of data and login code should also be done in jquery 

and use ajax as well 

Best of luck
